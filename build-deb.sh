Description: $DESCRIPTION
 Drinkingbird is a system activity monitor that tracks keyboard and mouse
 activity. When the system is idle for more than 3 minutes, it automatically
 moves the mouse slightly to prevent idle status in applications like Teams,
 Slack, etc. The movement is minimal and barely noticeable.
 .
 Features:
  - Real-time activity monitoring
  - Configurable idle threshold (default: 3 minutes)
  - Subtle mouse movement to prevent idle
  - Live status display
  - Clean shutdown with Ctrl+C

Drinkingbird - System Activity Monitor
======================================

Drinkingbird monitors your system activity and prevents it from going idle
by making subtle mouse movements when no activity is detected for a specified
period (default: 3 minutes).

Usage:
    drinkingbird                    # Start with 3-minute threshold
    
The program will display real-time status showing:
- Current time
- Last activity time
- Idle duration
- Threshold setting

Press Ctrl+C to stop the monitor.

Requirements:
- Python 3
- pynput library (automatically installed)

The mouse movements are minimal (1 pixel) and return to the original position,
making them virtually unnoticeable while effectively preventing idle status.
